TITLE: You May Be Right
Lyrics and Chords


Friday night I crashed your party
Saturday I said I'm sorry
Sunday came and trashed me out again
I was only having fun
Wasn't hurting anyone
And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change

/ A - / / A - E - / Bm - / G - / E - A - /

I've been stranded in the combat zone
I walked through Bedford Stuy alone
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain
And you told me not to drive
But I made it home alive
So you said that only proves that I'm insane

{Refrain}
You may be right, I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
Turn out the light, don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know, but you may be right

/ E - A - / E D F#m A / E - A - / D E A - /

Remember how I found you there
Alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
You were lonely for a man
I said take me as I am
'Cause you might enjoy some madness for awhile

Now think of all the years you tried to
Find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you say
If I'm crazy then it's true
That it's all because of you
And you wouldn't want me any other way

{Refrain}

You may be right, I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic youre looking for
It's too late to fight, it's too late to change me
You may be wrong for all I know, but you may be right

You may be wrong but you may be right (6x)
