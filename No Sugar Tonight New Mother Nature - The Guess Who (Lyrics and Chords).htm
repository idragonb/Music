TITLE: No Sugar Tonight/New Mother Nature
Lyrics and Chords


[ D* = <img src="./No Sugar Tonight New Mother Nature - The Guess Who (Lyrics and Chords)_files/NoSugarDstar.gif" alt="xx0030" align="abscenter"> ]

Lonely feeling, deep inside
Find a corner where I can hide
Silent footsteps crowding me
Sudden darkness, but I can see

/ D* D D* D / / / /

{Refrain}
No sugar tonight in my coffee
No sugar tonight in my tea
No sugar to stand beside me
No sugar to run with me
Da do da da...

/ D C / G D / :

In the silence of her mind
Quiet movements where I can find
Grabbing for me with her eyes
Now I'm falling from her skies

{Refrain}

Jock says yes, and I believe him
When we talk about the things I say
She hasn't got the faith or the guts to leave him
When they're standing in each other's way

/ D7 - / / / /

You're driven back now to places you've been to
You wonder what you're gonna find
You know you've been wrong but it won't be long
Before you leave 'em all far behind

{Second Refrain}
'Cause it's the new mother nature taking over
It's the new splendid lady come to call
It's the new mother nature taking over
She's getting us all, she's getting us all

/ G7 D7 / / / CD CD /

Jock said no when I came back last time
It's looking like I lost a friend
No use calling 'cause the sky is falling
And I'm getting pretty near the end

A smoke filled room in a corner basement
The situation must be right
A bag of goodies and a bottle of wine
We're gonna get it on right tonight

{Second Refrain}

Lonely feeling
     Jock says yes and I believe him
Deep inside
     When we talk about the things I say
Find a corner
     She hasn't got the faith or the guts to leave him
Where I can hide
     When they're standing in each other's way

Silent footsteps
     You're driven back now to places you've been to
Crowding me
     You wonder what you're gonna find
Sudden darkness
     You know you've been wrong and it won't be long
But I can see
     Before you leave 'em all far behind

{Second Refrain}

Da do da da...
