Lyrics and Chords


[ Em9 = <img src="./Hey You - Pink Floyd (Lyrics and Chords)_files/Em9.gif" alt="020002" align="ABSCENTER"> ]

Hey you, out there in the cold
Getting lonely, getting old
Can you feel me
Hey you, standing in the aisle
With itchy feet and fading smile
Can you feel me
Hey you, don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in without a fight

/ Em9 - / - / Bm - / : / D D7 GD C - / Bm Am Em - /

Hey you, out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me
Hey you, with your ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out
Would you touch me
Hey you, would you help me to carry the stone
Open your heart, I'm coming home

But it was only fantasy
The wall was too high, as you can see
No matter how he tried he could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain

/ C D GD C - - - / / / C D7 Em - - - Dm - - - /

Hey you, out there on the road
Always doing what you're told
Can you help me
Hey you, out there beyond the wall
Breaking bottles in the hall
Can you help me
Hey you, don't tell me there's no hope at all
Together we stand, divided we fall
