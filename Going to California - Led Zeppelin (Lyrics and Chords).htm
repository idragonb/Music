TITLE: Going to California
Lyrics and Chords


Spent my days with a woman unkind
Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine
Made up my mind to make a new start
Going to California with an aching in my heart
Someone told me there's a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair

/ G - / - - D - - - /:

Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let them tell you that they're all the same
The sea was red and the sky was gray
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today
The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
As the children of the sun began to wake

Seems that the wrath of the Gods
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow
I think I might be sinking
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path
Runs straight and high

/ Dm - / / A7 A7sus4 A7 - / :

To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings, la la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems

Ah, ah, ah, ah
