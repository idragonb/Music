TITLE: Casey Jones
Lyrics and Chords


<i>Sniff</i>

{Refrain}
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

/ C - F - / - - - C / :

This old engine makes it on time
Leaves Hazard Station 'bout a quarter to nine
Hits Trouble Junction at seventeen to
At a quarter to ten you know it's drivin' again

/ C - D - / F - G - / 1st / F E7 Am G7 /

{Refrain}

Trouble ahead, the lady in red
Take my advice, you'd be better off dead
Switchman sleeping, train hundred and two is
On the wrong track and headed for you,

/ C - C#D D / {as above}

{Refrain}

Trouble with you is the trouble with me
You got two good eyes but you still don't see
Come round the bend, you know it's the end
The fireman screams and the engine just gleams

{Refrain twice}

/ C - Bb F / - - - C / :

And you know that notion just crossed my mind

/ A7 D7 G7 C /
