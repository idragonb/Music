TITLE: Comfortably Numb
Lyrics and Chords


Hello - hello - hello
Is there anybody in there
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home

/ Bm - / A - / G Em / Bm - /

Come on, now
I hear you're feeling down
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again

Relax - relax - relax
I need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb
I have become comfortably numb

/ D - A - / / C - G - / / D - A - / / 
     / C - G - / C - / G - / A - C9 G D /

OK - OK - OK
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more <i>Aaaaaahhhhh!</i>
But you may feel a little sick

Can you stand up - stand up - stand up
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going for the show
Come on it's time to go

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown, the dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb
