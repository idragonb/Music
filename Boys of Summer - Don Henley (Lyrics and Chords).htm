Lyrics and Chords


[ Cadd9 = <img src="./Boys of Summer - Don Henley (Lyrics and Chords)_files/Cadd9.gif" alt="x32033" align="abscenter"> ]

Nobody on the road, nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air, the summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets, the sun goes down alone
I'm drivin' by your house though I know you're not home

/ Em - - - / Cadd9 - - - / D - - - / Cadd9 - - - /

But I can see you, your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got your hair combed back and your sunglasses on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

/ G - D - / - - Cadd9 - / :

I never will forget those nights, I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy, remember how I made you scream
Now I don't understand what happened to our love
But babe, I'm gonna get you back, I'm gonna show you what I'm made of

I can see you, your brown skin shinin' in the sun
I see you walkin' real slow and you're smilin' for everyone
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

Out on the road today, I saw a Dead Head sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said don't look back, you can never look back
I thought I knew what love was, what did I know
Those days are gone forever, I should just let them go but

I can see you, your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got that top pulled down and that radio on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I can see you, your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got your hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on, baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
