TITLE: Jailhouse Rock
Lyrics and Chords


Intro: / F#G G / /

The warden threw a party in the county jail
The prison band was there and they began to wail
The joint was jumpin' and the band began to swing
You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing

/ G - / / / /

{Refrain}
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody on the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock

/ C G / D C / D G /

Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joe was blowin' on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang

{Refrain}

Number forty-seven said to number three
"You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure would be delighted with your company
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me"

{Refrain}

The sad sack was a sittin' on a block of stone
Way over in the corner weepin' all alone
The warden said, "Hey, buddy, don't you be no square
If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair"

{Refrain}

Shifty Henry said to Bugs, "For Heaven's sake
No one's lookin', now's our chance to make a break"
Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, "Nix nix
I wanna stick around a while and get my kicks"

{Refrain}
