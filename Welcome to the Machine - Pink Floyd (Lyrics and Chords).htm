Lyrics and Chords


Welcome my son
Welcome to the machine
Where have you been
It's all right, we know where you've been
You've been in the pipe line filling in time
Provided with toys and scouting for boys
You bought a guitar to punish your ma
And you didn't like school
And you know you're nobody's fool
So welcome to the machine

/ Em - / Cmaj7 - Em - - - / C - / Am - Em - - - /
   / Cmaj7 - - - / Em - - - / C - - - / Em - / - - - - /
   / Cmaj7 - - - Em - - - /

Welcome my son
Welcome to the machine
What did you dream
It's all right, we told you what to dream
You dreamed of a big star
He played a mean guitar
He always ate in the steak bar
He loved to drive in his Jaguar
So welcome to the machine

/ Em - / Cmaj7 - Em - - - / C - / A - Em - - - /
   / Cmaj7 - - - / Em - - - / C - - - / Em - / - - - - /
   / Cmaj7 - - - Em - - - /
