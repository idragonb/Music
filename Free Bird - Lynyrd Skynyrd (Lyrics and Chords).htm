Lyrics and Chords


If I leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me
For I must be trav'ling on now
'Cause there's too many places I've got to see

/ G D Em - / F C D - / : 

{Refrain}
But if I stayed here with you girl
Things just couldn't be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you'll never change
And this bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows I can't change

/ " / " / " / F C D - / / / /

Bye, bye baby it's been a sweet love
Though this feeling I can't change
But please don't take it so badly
'Cause, Lord knows I'm to blame
 
{Refrain}

Lord help me, I can't change
Lord, I can't change
Won't you fly free bird, yeah
