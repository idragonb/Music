TITLE: Truckin'
Lyrics and Chords


Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

/ E - / A - / B7 - / A - E - /

Arrows of neon and flashin' marquees out on Main street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

/ E - / / E7 - / /

Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York's got the ways and means
That just won't let you be

Most of the cats that you meet on the street speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days, baby, they gotta get goin'
Out of the door and down on the street all alone

Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me "You got to play your hand
Sometimes the cards ain't worth a damn
If you don't lay 'em down"

{Refrain}
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

/ A - GD A / A DA GD A / D BF# - - / Amaj7 - E - /

What in the world ever became of sweet Jane
She's lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, vitamin C, and cocaine
All a friend can say is ain't it a shame

Truckin', up to Buffalo
Been thinkin' you got to mellow slow
It takes time, you pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowling pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be

You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

{Refrain}

Truckin', I'm a goin' home
Whoa, whoa baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
