TITLE: Brain Damage / Eclipse
Lyrics and Chords


The lunatic is on the grass
The lunatic is on the grass
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
Got to keep the loonies on the path

/ D - G7 - / / D - E - / A7 - D - /

The lunatic is in the hall
The lunatics are in my hall
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
And every day the paper boy brings more

... / A7 - D D7 / 

And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
And if there is no room upon the hill
And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

/ G - A - / C - G - / G - A7 - / C - G - (Bm7 Em7 A A7) /

The lunatic is in my head
The lunatic is in my head
You raise the blade, you make the change
You rearrange me 'til I'm sane
You lock the door and throw away the key
There's someone in my head but it's not me

And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear
You shout and no one seems to hear
And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

All that you touch and all that you see
All that you taste, all you feel

/ D - D7 - / Bb - A7 - / :

And all that you love and all that you hate
All you distrust, all you save

And all that you give and all that you deal
And all that you buy, beg, borrow or steal

And all you create and all you destroy
And all that you do and all that you say

And all that you eat and everyone you meet
And all that you slight and everyone you fight

And all that is now and all that is gone
And all that's to come and everything under the sun is in tune
But the sun is eclipsed by the moon

/ D - D7 - / Bb - A7 - D - / D7 - Bb - D - /
