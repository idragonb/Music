TITLE: Did You Ever Have to Make Up Your Mind
Lyrics and Chords


<b>Did you ever have to make up your mind
Pick up on one and leave the other behind
It's not often easy and not often kind
Did you ever have to make up your mind</b>

/ G C G C / G C G E / G D C - / D - G - /

<b>Did you ever have to finally decide
Say yes to one and let the other one ride
There's so many changes and tears you must hide
Did you ever have to finally decide</b>

Sometimes there's one with big blue eyes, cute as a bunny
With hair down to here, and plenty of money
And just when you think she's that one in the world
Your heart gets stolen by some mousey little girl

/ E7 - - - / A7 - - - / C A7 G E7 / D Dsus4 D Dsus4 / 

<b>And then you know you'd better make up your mind...</b>

Sometimes you really dig a girl the moment you kiss her
And then you get distracted by her older sister
When in walks her father and takes you a line
And says, "You better go home, son, and make up your mind"

<b>And then you bet you'd better finally decide...</b>
