TITLE: Carry On Wayward Son
Lyrics and Chords


{Refrain}
Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

/ Am C G GF / Am C G - / 1st / C - - /
    / AmC D G D / /

Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high

/ Am G F FG / / Dm C Bb BbC / Dm C G - /

Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming
I can hear them say

{Refrain}

/ Am C G GF / Am C G - / 1st / C - - /

Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, well
It surely means that I don't know

On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune
But I hear the voices say

{Refrain}
No!

/ Am G F G / / / /

Carry on, you will always remember
Carry on, nothing equals the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
Surely heaven waits for you

/ Am - F G / / Dm C Bb BbC / Dm C G - /

{Refrain}
