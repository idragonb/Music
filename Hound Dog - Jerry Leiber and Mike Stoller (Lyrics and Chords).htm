TITLE: Hound Dog
Lyrics and Chords


[As performed by Elvis Presley]

You ain't nothin' but a hound dog cryin' all the time
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog cryin' all the time
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit and you ain't no friend of mine

/ D - - - / G7 - D - / A7 G7 D - /

When they said you was high class, well, that was just a lie
When they said you was high class, well, that was just a lie
You ain't never caught a rabbit and you ain't no friend of mine

{Repeat all}
